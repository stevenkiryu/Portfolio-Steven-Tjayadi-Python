# Python Developer Portfolio 

Greetings! My name is Steven Tjayadi, and I'm excited to share my skill of developing portfolio related of Python skills. Within this repository, you'll find a comprehensive catalog of projects completed in various data analytics/engineering/Machine Learning/Web Development or self development projects with Python, each of which covers essential skills and techniques for Python Developer.

# Dockerize ETL Pipeline

- This project are used from Digital Skola Final Project that used a API Data Source from PIKOBAR. It used Orchestrator with Apache Airflow to automatically insert data and table and storing into Data Warehouse. It used PostgreSQL to store a data into Data Warehouse. The step of using this method in Apache Airflow are Gathering Data, Generate Dimension and Fact Data, And Insert a record to store into Data Warehouse. 
- Tools                : Apache Airflow, DBeaver, Docker Desktop, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Visual Studio Code
- Programming Language : Python, PostgreSQL, Powershell, Docker
- Output               : [ETL Pipeline](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LYRI7WIFcCcjsVvkOw6s7tVKA1XflIMN/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113716389537105758336&rtpof=true&sd=true)

# Laptop Recommendation System with Recurrent Neural Network

- This project use Python with the open-source Tensorflow for using Recurrent Neural Network and Text Processing. This app has also use UiPath Studio for Scraping the laptop data and QA Dialogue data. This app has been tested by 30 Participants with each review of the Recommendation laptop chatbot and has already been accepted by ICITDA organization. This app has been created by myself and with my co-author Mrs Viny Christanti Mawardi.
- Tools : Python, Tensorflow, UiPath Studio, Flask, SQLite, Web Development (HTML,CSS,Javascript)
- Output : [Virtual Assistant Kiryubot](http://valaptop.labirariset.com).

# Certification Validation

- This project use UiPath Studio with the help of OCR packages with Python which is one of the computer vision method to gather the text data. This project was also get helped with Cynthia Natalie in creating a Levenstein Distance Algorithm in UiPath Studio to Matching the text data in Certificate to prevent error of words. The Estimate of automation in each Student Account is 15 seconds depends of how many uploaded student certificate.
- Tools : UiPath Studio, UiPath cloud Orchestrator, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft SQL Server, Python, Web Development (UiPath Apps & ASP.NET)
- Output : [Certificate Valid Data Account](https://github.com/stevenkiryu/Portfolio-Steven-Tjayadi/assets/57402512/7a7d79b8-7420-480a-bb14-3b94a786ed84)

# Web Scrapping - SINTA Dosen & Kemendikbud Untar

- This project use UiPath Studio with using the selector method for web Scraping in UiPath. This method also use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) with Tesseract OCR from Python Language.
  This review get 2200 data of the Accuracy 80 % of Untar Dosen include the different subject like (Economics, IT, Law, etc).
- Tools : UiPath Studio, Python (TvExtract), Microsoft Excel, Microsoft SQL Server
- Output : [Dosen Sinta](https://github.com/stevenkiryu/Portfolio-Steven-Tjayadi/assets/57402512/75ef6423-05a9-4007-a59d-642d2c238237)

# Machine Learning - Batik Classification

- This project use Machine Learning based on Computer Vision(images) dataset. This project I work together with Nathaniel Distianto and Kenny Dwi Cahya. This result use Google Colab notebook with the detail explanation of code and step-by-step with Bahasa Indonesia. 

- Tools : Python, Google Colab, Gradient Boosting
- Output : [Batik Classification](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1k0z8XizGXNYBpuInOvGVEOioeRHtrq0K)

# Machine Learning - Clustering Detik News

- This project use Machine Learning based on Natural Language Processing(text) dataset. This project I work together with Nathaniel Distianto and Kenny Dwi Cahya. This result use Google Colab notebook with the detail explanation of code and step-by-step with Bahasa Indonesia. 

- Tools : Python, Google Colab, K-Means, Natural Language Processing
- Output : [Clustering Detik News](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bPDQpS0gzu9mjfVgO4mk3nDP1HjvAHKq#scrollTo=_zB19ZJG3ZC5)

# Numerical Method - Calculate trapezoidal and Simpson 1/3 Integral

- This project was based on advanced mathematics (Numerical Method) in Tarumanagara University. I was task to solve of trapezoidal and Simposn 1/3 Integral. Python was good programming language to use to calculate based on Calculus calculation because it has much library from it. This python has 2 type of output which use .py format for the User Interface application with Tkinter and .ipynb with Jupyter Notebook for the sample output of calculating trapezoidal and Simpson 1/3 Integral.  

- Tools : Python, Tkinter, Jupyter Notebook
- Output : [Numerical Method Project](https://github.com/stevenkiryu/Numerical-Method-Metnum-)
